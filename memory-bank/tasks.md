## Current Task: VAN Mode Assessment
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Started**: $(date)
**Completed**: $(date)

### VAN Mode Checklist
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank system
- [x] Create core Memory Bank files
- [x] Analyze project structure
- [x] Understand project purpose and scope
- [x] Determine complexity level
- [x] Identify immediate needs/requirements
- [x] Plan next development phase
- [x] Complete VAN mode assessment

### Project Assessment
**Project Type**: MCP Server for Atlassian Integration
**Technology Stack**: Python, MCP Protocol, Atlassian APIs
**Current State**: Production-ready codebase with comprehensive testing

### Complexity Indicators
- **Codebase Size**: Large (78 source files, 18,576 lines of code)
- **Test Coverage**: Extensive (88 test files, 1,014 test cases)
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests (all passing)
- **Documentation**: Well-documented with multiple guides
- **Dependencies**: Multiple external dependencies and integrations
- **Code Quality**: 627 linting issues identified (mostly style/formatting)

### Complexity Level Determination
**Level: 2 (Simple Enhancement)**
- Project is mature and well-structured
- Tests are passing, indicating functional stability
- Main issues are code quality/style improvements
- No critical bugs or architectural problems identified

### Immediate Needs Identified
1. **Code Quality Issues**: 627 linting violations
   - 390 line-too-long (E501)
   - 99 blind-except (BLE001)
   - 71 f-string-in-exception (EM102)
   - 47 boolean argument issues (FBT001/FBT002)
   - 20 other minor issues

2. **Code Style Standardization**: Need to apply consistent formatting

### Next Phase Decision
**Recommended**: Level 2 Simple Enhancement
- Focus on code quality improvements
- Address linting issues systematically
- Maintain existing functionality
- Improve code maintainability

### Action Plan
1. **IMPLEMENT Mode**: Address code quality issues
2. **QA Mode**: Verify improvements don't break functionality
3. **REFLECT Mode**: Document improvements and lessons learned

### Notes
- Project appears mature and well-structured
- Comprehensive test coverage indicates high quality standards
- Multiple deployment and configuration options available
- Active development with good documentation
- Code quality improvements will enhance maintainability
