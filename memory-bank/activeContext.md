- Captured the product vision and user experience goals
- Identified key design patterns and integration approaches

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Cline Integration Optimization**:
   - Test write operations by setting `READ_ONLY_MODE=false` when needed
   - Explore advanced Cline workflows with MCP Atlassian tools
   - Document best practices for Cline + MCP Atlassian usage
   - Create example tasks and workflows for common use cases

2. **MCP Server Monitoring**:
   - Monitor MCP server health and performance through Cline integration
   - Watch for any authentication or connectivity issues
   - Ensure continued access to all 42 tools (26 Jira + 16 Confluence)
   - Monitor verbose logging output for optimization opportunities

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update Confluence documentation with Cline integration instructions
   - Add local source execution examples to existing guides
   - Document the proven Cline configuration approach
   - Create troubleshooting section for Cline-specific issues

4. **Memory Bank Maintenance**:
   - Monitor for project changes that require memory bank updates
   - Keep documentation current with codebase evolution
   - Review and refine memory bank content based on Cline usage patterns

### Future Considerations
- Monitor for new feature development
- Track authentication method improvements
- Watch for MCP protocol updates
- Consider performance optimizations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **FastMCP Framework**: Chosen for MCP protocol compliance and transport flexibility
- **Modular Design**: Separate Jira and Confluence modules for clear separation of concerns
- **Docker-First**: Primary distribution method for consistent deployment
- **Environment-Based Config**: All configuration via environment variables for container compatibility

### Authentication Strategy
- **Multi-Method Support**: Support all major Atlassian authentication methods
- **User Context Isolation**: Per-request authentication for multi-user scenarios
- **Token Security**: Comprehensive token masking and secure storage
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when authentication is incomplete

### Tool Design Philosophy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Provide tools for all common Atlassian operations
- **Read/Write Separation**: Clear distinction between read and write operations
- **Filtering Support**: Configurable tool access and read-only modes
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all tools

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Handling different Atlassian cloud instances in multi-user scenarios
- **Token Management**: Balancing security with usability for OAuth token refresh
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintaining low latency while supporting comprehensive functionality
- **Enterprise Integration**: Supporting diverse corporate network and security requirements

### Development Challenges
- **Testing Complexity**: Comprehensive testing across multiple authentication methods and deployment types
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping documentation current with rapid feature development
- **Backward Compatibility**: Supporting older Atlassian Server/Data Center versions
- **Configuration Complexity**: Balancing flexibility with ease of setup

## Context for Future Work

### Key Files to Monitor
- `src/mcp_atlassian/servers/main.py` - Main server implementation and tool filtering
- `src/mcp_atlassian/*/config.py` - Configuration management for each service
- `src/mcp_atlassian/utils/` - Shared utilities and common functionality
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation and setup instructions
- `.env` - Current environment configuration (API tokens, URLs)

### Confluence Documentation Links
- **MCP Initialization Guide**: https://arsenykonohov2.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TS/pages/1540097
- **MCP Testing Guide**: https://arsenykonohov2.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TS/pages/1572865

### Important Patterns
- **Tool Registration**: Each service registers tools using FastMCP decorators
- **Configuration Loading**: Environment-based configuration with validation
- **Error Handling**: Layered error handling from API to tool level
- **Authentication Flow**: Multi-method authentication with fallback support

### Development Workflow
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated code quality enforcement
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and real API validation tests
- **Docker Build**: Multi-stage builds for optimization
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and building

## Memory Bank Maintenance

### Update Triggers
- Significant architectural changes
- New authentication methods
- Major feature additions
- Performance optimizations
- Security improvements

### Review Schedule
- After major releases
- When adding new tools or services
- When authentication methods change
- When deployment patterns evolve

This memory bank should be updated whenever significant changes occur to ensure it remains an accurate reflection of the project's current state and future direction.
