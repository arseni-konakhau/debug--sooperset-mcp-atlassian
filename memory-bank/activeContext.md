## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **FastMCP Framework**: Chosen for MCP protocol compliance and transport flexibility
- **Modular Design**: Separate Jira and Confluence modules for clear separation of concerns
- **Docker-First**: Primary distribution method for consistent deployment
- **Environment-Based Config**: All configuration via environment variables for container compatibility

### Authentication Strategy
- **Multi-Method Support**: Support all major Atlassian authentication methods
- **User Context Isolation**: Per-request authentication for multi-user scenarios
- **Token Security**: Comprehensive token masking and secure storage
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when authentication is incomplete

### Tool Design Philosophy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Provide tools for all common Atlassian operations
- **Read/Write Separation**: Clear distinction between read and write operations
- **Filtering Support**: Configurable tool access and read-only modes
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all tools

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Handling different Atlassian cloud instances in multi-user scenarios
- **Token Management**: Balancing security with usability for OAuth token refresh
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintaining low latency while supporting comprehensive functionality
- **Enterprise Integration**: Supporting diverse corporate network and security requirements

### Development Challenges
- **Testing Complexity**: Comprehensive testing across multiple authentication methods and deployment types
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping documentation current with rapid feature development
- **Backward Compatibility**: Supporting older Atlassian Server/Data Center versions
- **Configuration Complexity**: Balancing flexibility with ease of setup

## Context for Future Work
