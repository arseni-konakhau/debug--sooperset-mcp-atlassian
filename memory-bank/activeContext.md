# Active Context: MCP Atlassian

## Current Work Focus

### Testing Infrastructure Consolidation
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Goal**: Consolidate and streamline the testing files based on proven successful workflow

**Completed**:
- ✅ Consolidated multiple testing markdown files into single `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ Removed redundant files: `MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `QUICK_TEST_REFERENCE.md`, `TESTING_README.md`
- ✅ Updated `setup_test_environment.sh` (renamed from `setup_dev_environment.sh`)
- ✅ Kept successful scripts: `install_dependencies.py`, `simple_test.py`, `manual_test_debug.py`
- ✅ Updated references to point to new consolidated documentation
- ✅ Verified proven workflow: `python3 install_dependencies.py` → `cp .env.debug .env` → `uv run python3 simple_test.py --verbose`

### Project Understanding
Based on the codebase analysis, MCP Atlassian is a mature, production-ready project with:
- Comprehensive Jira and Confluence integration
- Multiple authentication methods (API tokens, PAT, OAuth 2.0)
- Docker-first distribution model
- Extensive tool coverage (30+ tools across both platforms)
- Enterprise-grade features (proxy support, custom headers, multi-user auth)
- Streamlined testing infrastructure with proven workflow

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Structure
- Established the core memory bank files following the .clinerules specification
- Documented the complete architecture and technology stack
- Captured the product vision and user experience goals
- Identified key design patterns and integration approaches

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Memory Bank Maintenance**:
   - Monitor for project changes that require memory bank updates
   - Keep documentation current with codebase evolution
   - Review and refine memory bank content based on usage

2. **Project Analysis**:
   - Understand current development priorities
   - Identify any outstanding issues or feature requests
   - Review recent commits and changes

3. **Documentation Review**:
   - Ensure memory bank accurately reflects current codebase state
   - Update any outdated information
   - Add any missing context or patterns

### Future Considerations
- Monitor for new feature development
- Track authentication method improvements
- Watch for MCP protocol updates
- Consider performance optimizations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **FastMCP Framework**: Chosen for MCP protocol compliance and transport flexibility
- **Modular Design**: Separate Jira and Confluence modules for clear separation of concerns
- **Docker-First**: Primary distribution method for consistent deployment
- **Environment-Based Config**: All configuration via environment variables for container compatibility

### Authentication Strategy
- **Multi-Method Support**: Support all major Atlassian authentication methods
- **User Context Isolation**: Per-request authentication for multi-user scenarios
- **Token Security**: Comprehensive token masking and secure storage
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when authentication is incomplete

### Tool Design Philosophy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Provide tools for all common Atlassian operations
- **Read/Write Separation**: Clear distinction between read and write operations
- **Filtering Support**: Configurable tool access and read-only modes
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all tools

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Handling different Atlassian cloud instances in multi-user scenarios
- **Token Management**: Balancing security with usability for OAuth token refresh
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintaining low latency while supporting comprehensive functionality
- **Enterprise Integration**: Supporting diverse corporate network and security requirements

### Development Challenges
- **Testing Complexity**: Comprehensive testing across multiple authentication methods and deployment types
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping documentation current with rapid feature development
- **Backward Compatibility**: Supporting older Atlassian Server/Data Center versions
- **Configuration Complexity**: Balancing flexibility with ease of setup

## Context for Future Work

### Key Files to Monitor
- `src/mcp_atlassian/servers/main.py` - Main server implementation and tool filtering
- `src/mcp_atlassian/*/config.py` - Configuration management for each service
- `src/mcp_atlassian/utils/` - Shared utilities and common functionality
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation and setup instructions

### Important Patterns
- **Tool Registration**: Each service registers tools using FastMCP decorators
- **Configuration Loading**: Environment-based configuration with validation
- **Error Handling**: Layered error handling from API to tool level
- **Authentication Flow**: Multi-method authentication with fallback support

### Development Workflow
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated code quality enforcement
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and real API validation tests
- **Docker Build**: Multi-stage builds for optimization
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and building

## Memory Bank Maintenance

### Update Triggers
- Significant architectural changes
- New authentication methods
- Major feature additions
- Performance optimizations
- Security improvements

### Review Schedule
- After major releases
- When adding new tools or services
- When authentication methods change
- When deployment patterns evolve

This memory bank should be updated whenever significant changes occur to ensure it remains an accurate reflection of the project's current state and future direction.
