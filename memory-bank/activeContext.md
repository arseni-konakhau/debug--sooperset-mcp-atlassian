# Active Context: MCP Atlassian

## Current Work Focus

### HTTP Transport Validation & Tool Correction
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Goal**: Validate HTTP transport functionality and correct tool examples based on actual available tools

**Completed**:
- ✅ **HTTP Transport Protocol Analysis**: Identified and resolved MCP protocol initialization issues
  - **Root Cause**: Missing `notifications/initialized` step in MCP handshake sequence
  - **Solution**: Added required initialization notification after `initialize` request
  - **Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP protocol handshake now working correctly
- ✅ **Tool Name Validation & Correction**: Updated `_http/validate.http` with correct tool names and parameters
  - **Tool Name Fixes**: `jira_search_issues` → `jira_search`, `jira_list_projects` → `jira_get_all_projects`
  - **Parameter Corrections**: `max_results` → `limit`, `transition_name` → `transition_id`
  - **Structure Fixes**: Fixed `jira_update_issue` to use proper `fields` parameter structure
  - **Real Examples**: Updated with actual SMP project keys and issue numbers (SMP-1)
  - **Enhanced Coverage**: Added examples for `jira_get_user_profile` and advanced field selections
- ✅ **HTTP Validation File Enhancement**: Created production-ready `_http/validate.http` file
  - **Complete MCP workflow**: Initialize → Notify → Tools List → Tool Calls
  - **Session management**: Proper session ID handling and reuse
  - **Content negotiation**: Correct Accept headers for FastMCP framework
  - **Authentication examples**: OAuth, PAT, and multi-user authentication patterns
  - **Valid Tool Examples**: All examples now use correct tool names from actual server implementation
- ✅ **Remote Deployment Readiness**: HTTP transport fully validated for remote server deployment
  - **Transport command**: `uv run mcp-atlassian --transport streamable-http --port 9000 --env-file .env --verbose`
  - **Client compatibility**: Ready for external client connections
  - **Production validation**: Complete testing workflow for remote deployments
- ✅ **MCP Protocol Deep Understanding**: Documented complete initialization sequence
  - **Step 1**: `initialize` request with client capabilities
  - **Step 2**: `notifications/initialized` notification (CRITICAL - was missing)
  - **Step 3**: Tools and operations available after proper handshake
  - **Error Resolution**: Fixed "Invalid request parameters" and "initialization incomplete" errors
